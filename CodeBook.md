Labels were added to the dataset to easily identify the activity made by the subject
ActivityLabels


###Data Set Summary Fields
In this dataset data was reshaped in order to have the average over previous variables having Activity Labels and Subject Codes as the classification factors

ActivityLabels: human readable value for the activity. One of: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
SubjectCode: the given code of the observed subject
variable: the observed variable
MeanValue: the average value for the given variable for the observed subject split by activity
